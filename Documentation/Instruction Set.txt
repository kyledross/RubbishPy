About labels
When referencing a label, classic syntax is to use a colon prefix.
This behavior has been relaxed, and the colon prefix in the reference is no longer required.
For example, CALL :labelAddress and CALL labelAddress are both valid.

Set Interrupt Vector
SIV interrupt address
SIV interrupt :labelAddress

Opcode: 26
Purpose: When the interrupt occurs, the current instruction pointer is pushed into an instruction pointer cache and processor jumps to the address.
Processor: v1

Call code
CALL address
CALL :labelAddress
CALL labelAddress
Opcode: 20
Purpose: Pushes current instruction pointer into an instruction pointer stack, pushes all general purpose registers into a register stack, and jumps to the address.
Processor: v1

Return
RETURN
Opcode: 21
Purpose: Pops instruction pointer off instruction pointer stack, pops general purpose registers off of the register stack, and continues executing at the next address.

-- Processor control

Halt Processor
HALT
Opcode:9
Processor: v1

Debug
DEBUG
Opcode:10
Processor: v1

Reset Processor (not supported by Rubbish Processor)
RST
Opcode:12

Sleep
SLEEP
Opcode: 28
Purpose: Causes processor to remain in a state where no instructions are processed until an interrupt is handled.  The processor will return to sleep after a RTN.
Processor: v1

Wake
WAKE
Opcode: 29
Purpose: Causes processor to resume processing instructions. Cancels any previous SLEEP instruction.  Typically found in the code of an interrupt vector, as it can't be reached in any other fashion if the processor is already asleep from a prior SLEEP instruction.
Processor: v1

Debug Out
DEBUGOUT
Opcode: 35
Purpose: Causes the processor to output the contents of the debug_stack to the local console
Processor: v3

Debug Push

Purpose: Pushes the value onto the debug_stack
Processor: v3

=======================================================
Compiler Meta-commands

labelname:
Purpose: Represents an address in the compiled code.  Typically used as an address for jumps and interrupt vectors as well as for locating data in the program.
Example: someLabel:
Compiler: v1

DATA string
Purpose: Directly inserts the string as bytes into the compiled program. Typically used with a label so that the data can be located.  Supports \r, \n, and \0 for carriage returns, line feeds, and ASCII NUL.
Example: someLabel: DATA This is a string.\r\n\0
Compiler: v1.1

'
Purpose: Comment in code.  These lines are not compiled.
Example: ' This is a comment
Compiler: v1

=======================================================
Pointers

:labelAddress pointer
labelAddress pointer
Purpose: Represents the address where the label is found.
Example: LRM 4 :someLabel   - would move the value located at the specified label into register 4
Example: LRM 4 someLabel    - would move the value located at the specified label into register 4
Any instruction that takes an address as a parameter can use the :labelAddress or labelAddress pointer
Processor: v1.0
Compiler: v1.1

@register pointer
Purpose: Represents an address of a value to use.  Typically used to load a value from memory whose address is in a register.
Example:  LRM 2 @4    - would load the value at the address located in register 4 into register 2
The @register pointer can only be used with certain instructions (see the instruction's information for details)
Note: This pointer generates code that requires Rubbish Processor Version 1.1 or later
Processor: v1.1
Compiler: v1.1
